# Script:   code challenge 4              
# Author: Raheem Sharif Reed                     
# Date of latest revision: July 18,2023     
# Purpose:In Python, create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:
#Prompt the user to select a mode:
#Encrypt a file (mode 1)
#Decrypt a file (mode 2)
#Encrypt a message (mode 3)
#Decrypt a message (mode 4)
#If mode 1 or 2 are selected, prompt the user to provide a filepath to a target file.
#If mode 3 or 4 are selected, prompt the user to provide a cleartext string.
#Depending on the selection, perform one of the below functions. Youâ€™ll need to create four functions:
#Encrypt the target file if in mode 1.
#Delete the existing target file and replace it entirely with the encrypted version.
#Decrypt the target file if in mode 2.
#Delete the encrypted target file and replace it entirely with the decrypted version.
#Encrypt the string if in mode 3.
#Print the ciphertext to the screen.
#Decrypt the string if in mode 4.
#Print the cleartext to the screen.
#Recursively encrypt a single folder and all its contents.
#Recursively decrypt a single folder that was encrypted by this tool.
