# Script:   code challenge 7            
# Author: Raheem Sharif Reed                     
# Date of latest revision: July 25,2023      
# Purpose:In Python, create a TCP Port Range Scanner that tests whether a TCP port is open or closed. The script must:
#Utilize the scapy library
#Define host IP
#Define port range or specific set of ports to scan
#Test each port in the specified range using a for loopIf flag 0x12 received, send a RST packet to graciously close the open connection. Notify the user the port is open.
#If flag 0x14 received, notify user the port is closed.
#If no flag is received, notify the user the port is filtered and silently dropped.
#User menu prompting choice between TCP Port Range Scanner mode and ICMP Ping Sweep mode, with the former leading to yesterdayâ€™s feature set
#CMP Ping Sweep tool Prompt user for network address including CIDR block
#Create a list of all addresses in the given network
#f ICMP type is 3 and ICMP code is either 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13 then inform the user that the host is actively blocking ICMP traffic.
#Otherwise, inform the user that the host is responding.
#Count how many hosts are online and inform the user.
